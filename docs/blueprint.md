# **App Name**: LingoFlow AI

## Core Features:

- Scenario Selection: Allow users to choose from a variety of German conversation scenarios (e.g., Travel, Office) and sub-topics (e.g., Café, Meeting intro) to tailor the AI's responses using a dropdown menu that drives the system prompt.
- AI Chat Interface: Provide a conversational UI for users to interact with the AI tutor, displaying messages in a streaming format.
- Contextual Correction Tool: AI detects grammar and phrasing issues, offering corrections and brief explanations, all while ensuring its analysis is appropriate for the given context.
- Tap-to-Translate Word Lookup: Enable users to tap on any word in the chat interface (AI or user messages) to instantly view its translation and part-of-speech via DeepL or Google Translate.
- Session Summaries: AI provides an automated session summary: compiles key corrections, saved vocabulary, and suggestions for practice based on the user's progress in the session. LLM decides which of these to present, acting as a tool to surface relevant info.
- User Accounts & Progress Tracking: Allows users to register an account with email authentication and have all of their conversation and learning progress saved for future use.
